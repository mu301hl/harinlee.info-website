abstract: 'To date, tests that measure individual differences in the ability to perceive
  musical timbre are scarce in the published literature. The lack of such tool limits
  research on how timbre, a primary attribute of sound, is perceived and processed
  among individuals. The current paper describes the development of the Timbre Perception
  Test (TPT), in which participants use a slider to reproduce heard auditory stimuli
  that vary along three important dimensions of timbre: envelope, spectral flux, and
  spectral centroid. With a sample of 95 participants, the TPT was calibrated and
  validated against measures of related abilities and examined for its reliability.
  The results indicate that a short-version (8 minutes) of the TPT has good explanatory
  support from a factor analysis model, acceptable internal reliability (α = .69,
  ωt = .70), good test–retest reliability (r = .79) and substantial correlations with
  self-reported general musical sophistication (ρ = .63) and pitch discrimination
  (ρ = .56), as well as somewhat lower correlations with duration discrimination (ρ
  = .27), and musical instrument discrimination abilities (ρ = .33). Overall, the
  TPT represents a robust tool to measure an individual’s timbre perception ability.
  Furthermore, the use of sliders to perform a reproductive task has shown to be an
  effective approach in threshold testing. The current version of the TPT is openly
  available for research purposes.'
