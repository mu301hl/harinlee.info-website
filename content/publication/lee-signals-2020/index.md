abstract: Previous studies have suggested that the prosocial effects which arise following
  synchrony during music and dance may serve as a mechanism for people to bond socially.
  However, other research has proposed that synchrony could be a mechanism for signalling
  coalition to demonstrate fitness, which is expressed by a group's ability to effectively
  cooperate. In the present studies, we compared these theories by showing participants
  realistic virtual avatars engaged in different forms of group dance and then examining
  their perceived social closeness and formidability of the dance groups. We conducted
  two studies to assess the perceptual influence of movement type (unison vs. coordinated)
  and movement quality (temporally aligned vs. temporally misaligned). We predicted
  that the difference in the ratings of closeness and formidability would only emerge
  when the groups align movements, and this was supported. We also hypothesised that
  unison movement would better signal formidability while coordinated movement would
  better signal a group's social closeness. However, unison movement yielded higher
  ratings than coordinated movement for both formidability and social closeness, suggesting
  that a group should move in complete synchrony to maximally indicate their fitness
  and social bonds.
