Trend in music changes over time and reflects the cultural expression of its time. By treating musical recordings like fossil records to study its historical path, we apply a data-driven approach to provide a quantitative picture of how popular music have evolved since the 1940s to present day in different parts of the world. The project aims to build a novel dataset (~ 2 million entries) that combines music chart records of more than 20 countries with their auditory features retrieved using music informaion retrieval (MIR) algorithms, as well as meta-data and lyrics obtained through API.
