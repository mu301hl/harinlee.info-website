Iâ€™m interested in why music, often accompanied by dance, exists across all cultures when there is no direct link to our survival. I intend to find how music could've evolved, drawing from music's global role and its relationships to our neural and physical mechanics. Coming from a sound engineering background, I'm also intrigued by the physical properties of sound and how it's translated in our brain. I wish to investigate more about our auditory perception and to what extent it's global or culture specific.
